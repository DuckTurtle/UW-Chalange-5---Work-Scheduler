# UW-Chalange-5---Work-Scheduler

## Discription
This is an electronic sceduler. Icreated this to have a scedular that is a portable as my phone, because it is. I learned that javascript and jquery don't work together
and how to better use dayjs and jquery.

## Instalation
There is no instalation.

## Usage
The only feature the user can interact with is the text box's where the user writes and saves events. Otherwise there is the current time diplaed at the top of the page, 
and the color coding to indacate wether a timeblock is past, present, or in the future.
